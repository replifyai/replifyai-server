## Technical Implementation

### Model Configuration

```typescript
model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
max_tokens: 16000
temperature: 0
```

### Processing Flow

1. **PDF Upload** → Convert to base64
2. **Send to Claude** → Comprehensive extraction request
3. **Text Processing** → Clean and normalize
4. **Visual Extraction** → Parse visual element descriptions
5. **Chunking** → Associate visuals with relevant text chunks
6. **Indexing** → Store with full metadata for search

### Fallback Mechanism

If Claude extraction fails:
1. Falls back to traditional pdf2json method
2. Logs warning for monitoring
3. Continues processing without visual descriptions
4. Maintains backward compatibility

## Benefits for RAG System

### Enhanced Search Capabilities

Users can now search for:
- **"Show me the marketing flowchart"** → Finds pages with marketing diagrams
- **"What are the pain statistics?"** → Retrieves pages with pain percentage data
- **"Describe the geographic distribution"** → Finds map descriptions
- **"Product evolution strategy"** → Locates strategy diagrams

### Better Context Understanding

- AI responses include visual context
- Diagrams are explained in text form
- Process flows are preserved
- Data visualizations are accessible

### Comprehensive Knowledge Base

- No information loss from visual content
- Diagrams become searchable text
- Charts provide data points
- Maps offer location information

## Environment Setup

```bash
# Required environment variable
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

The enhanced extraction is automatic for all PDF uploads:

```typescript
// Automatically uses Claude for PDFs
await documentProcessor.processDocument(document, fileBuffer, sourceUrl);
```

## Monitoring

Check logs for extraction details:
```
✅ Claude extracted 15234 characters (including visual descriptions)
✅ Found 5 visual elements
Processing PDF with Claude 3.5 Sonnet...
```

## Cost Considerations

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: ~$3 per million input tokens
- 16,000 tokens = ~$0.048 per document
- High-quality extraction justifies cost
- Fallback available if API limits reached

## Best Practices

1. **For large PDFs**: Consider splitting into sections if >50 pages
2. **Token management**: Monitor extraction lengths
3. **Error handling**: Always have fallback enabled
4. **Quality checks**: Validate critical documents manually
5. **Caching**: Store extracted content to avoid re-processing
